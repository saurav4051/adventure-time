                An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky.
            <br>
            <br>
            An experience should meet several criteria to be considered an adventure:
            <br>

1. Be remarkableâ€”that is, worth talking about<br>
2. Involve adversity or perceived risk<br>
3. Bring about personal growth.

                    The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

                        Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance.
